Here we can add (ideally) Markdown (or html...),
documentation to later include when asking AI to do sth with scripts.

E.g. using:

```
./try_with_jina.ai.py
```

However!

It is far from perfect!
So please, double check output!

And copy&paste needed data e.g. with:

* https://github.com/notlmn/copy-as-markdown

and if needed later pass through some LLM asking to make it nice for humans without html tags, etc.
