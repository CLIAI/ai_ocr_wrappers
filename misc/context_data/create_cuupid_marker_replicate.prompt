Please implement `pdfextractors/cuuupid_marker_replicate.py` to be pdf2markdown
converter.

Given we use replicate.com API service,
take inspiration from :
`misc/code_samples/colorize_with_camenduru_colorize-line-art_replicate.com.sh`
`misc/code_samples/replicate_com_flux_schnell.py`
`misc/code_samples/replicate_com_flux_schnell.sh`

keep style and functionalities they offer,
especially idempotency, by making script first check if outputs
exist and skip if outputs already exist and suceed,
to allow running tool multiple times in pipeline,
and having processing behind only once.

Regarding API of model which we want to use, use information from:

`docs/replicate.com/replicate.com_cuupid_marker.md`
`docs/replicate.com/replicate.com_cuupid_markerapi.md`
`docs/replicate.com/replicate.com_cuupid_markerschema.md`
